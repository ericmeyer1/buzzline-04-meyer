What It Does
The Gospel Message Analyzer processes real-time JSON messages to:

Detect Gospel Content: Scans for Christian keywords (salvation, Jesus, faith, scripture, grace, witness, truth, eternity)
Measure Bold Witness: Identifies high-impact gospel messages with positive sentiment
Find Evangelistic Opportunities: Detects messages expressing struggle, seeking, or spiritual questions
Track Ministry Effectiveness: Provides real-time metrics on gospel sharing success
Encourage Boldness: Biblical inspiration and challenges to share Christ more intentionally

Insight Focus
Gospel Message Analysis and Digital Evangelism Effectiveness
"Therefore go and make disciples of all nations..." - Matthew 28:19
This analysis helps believers understand their digital witness impact, identify missed opportunities for gospel conversations, and encourages more intentional Christian testimony online.

## Visualization Types

## Running the Project

Step 1: Start the Required Producer

The project uses the provided producer without any modifications:
bash# Run the basic JSON producer (generates sample messages)
python -m producers.basic_json_producer_case
This will start generating JSON messages to the data/buzz_live.json file with the format:
json{
    "message": "I just shared a movie! It was amazing.",
    "author": "Charlie",
    "timestamp": "2025-01-29 14:35:20",
    "category": "humor",
    "sentiment": 0.87,
    "keyword_mentioned": "movie",
    "message_length": 42
}

Step 2: Run a Consumer

Option A: Original Basic Consumer (Provided Example)
To run the original basic consumer that counts messages by author:
bash# In a new terminal window (keep producer running)
python -m consumers.basic_json_consumer_case
This will display a live bar chart showing message counts by author.

Option B: New Gospel Message Analyzer Consumer
To run the new gospel-focused consumer:
bash# In a new terminal window (keep producer running)
python -m consumers.project_consumer_gospel
Then open your browser and navigate to:

Dashboard: gospel_dashboard.html (auto-refreshes every 3 seconds)
Charts: Will be saved in charts/gospel_analysis.png
